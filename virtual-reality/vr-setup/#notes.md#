Top-end VR setup

The Varjo headsets are the best HMDs (head-mounted displays) in terms of optics, both in terms of pixels-per-degree (PPD) and their use of pancake (non-fresnel) lenses.

They are the only ones that can be used as a substitute for actual flight time in training toward a pilots license.

Recommendation: Varjo Aero
It is the only consumer device they sell.

Other HMDs:

Varjo:
- The Varjo XR3 is the best stand-alone/wireless headset, but it costs a lot more, has an annual fee, and is technically only sold directly to business, and you would have to deal with export/import paperwork.
- The Varjo VR3 is the wired version of the XR3. It has two pairs of lenses, for even clearer imaging, but it requires two cables, and is much heavier than the Aero.

Facebook/Meta:
- Now has released the Quest Pro.
It is standalone/wireless, with better clarity, but it intentionally allows light in from the bottom of the lenses. It is not well received by those who have used it. It does support apps that allow rendering to happen on the PC so you can interface with your desktop, or use a PC's GPU to render a VR game and display it on the HMD. The good thing about this is that it works without a PC, and like the Quest-2, has advanced hand-tracking and a nice GUI. Microsoft and FB have partnered to put Office-365 on this thing, but as I mentioned, you can do that or access any 2-d app on any PC-VR headset using the app "Virtual Desktop".

Pimax Crystal and their 8KX are somewhat on par with the Aero, but the company is famous for:
- bad support
- inconsistent hardware (some people have had to return multiple times to get good hw)
- generally catering more to their customers in China.
Their 12X-QLED, if it releases next year or so, could be amazing. It is a wish-list of features that people hope/expect the Steam Index successor, (Deckard) might be if that thing turns out to be more than a rumor (Steam is famous for just releasing things with no announcements).

The Valve Index is 2 years old but is still the choice for e-sports VR competitive players due to the FOV and high frame rate (120 Hz). The down side for this is the resolution and screen-door-effect (SDE) meaning you can see a grid of lines between the pixels if you focus hard enough.

Step #1: Varjo Aero HMD

https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/virtual-reality/products/varjo-aero-headset/352189.html?condition=New&sku=20001267.html

Notes/Background:
- The Aero HMD does not include the base-stations or controllers.
- The Aero uses the "Steam tracking system", which was created for the HTC Vive
and is used by the Valve Index (and some other VR HMDs and tracking devices)
- The HTC Vive "wand" controllers are not good.
- The HTC Vive Steam Tracking system was v1. The Index has V2 which extends the range and angles that the trackers work at. Get v2 if possible, but v1 works.
- The Index Knuckle controllers are the gold standard for VR controllers.

Step #2: Steam Base Stations and (Index Knuckle) controllers.
You should get two base stations and the Index Knuckle controllers.
You can get them separately, or get the full (999) Index kit.

If they are out of stock, you can roll the dice on this

Step #3: PC with a sufficient GPU
The Varjo Aero is only vertified with Nvidia GPUs.

I have and recommend the Nvidia and a 3090 (or 4090 which are just out) GPU.
Some apps still work better with Intel than AMD, so I went with Intel CPU.

This is what I got 2 years ago:

But now, the 4090 GPUs are out:
Here is an Intel+NVidia monster,

Step #4: Audio Solution
The Aero is only the HMD, and needs a solution for speakers and microphone.
You can use a BlueTooth headset, but that introduced some lag and distortion that I did not like. I have one of these:

Step #5: Option - VR Car Racing (improve your driving skillz)


IRacing simulator software
https://www.iracing.com/
This is not the highest fidelity graphics but it is the best physics engine to learn real racing skills.
FWIW, I did this for a few weeks and then went go-kart racing and came in 1st and 2nd in all races.

Andy and I have raced with some friends from his racing league.
This is very fun. e.g. https://varjo.com/vr-sim-racing/
You can practice heel-toe maneuvers etc if you have a proper chair, wheel, gearbox setup.

Wheels and wheel-bases (for feedback)
https://fanatec.com/us-en/racing-wheels-wheel-bases/

Chair-1: this is decent for a folding chair. You can mount pedals to it.

Chair-2: this is better, but doesn't fold up

Step #6: Option - Motion Simulator chair/environment

These range from ~$3k to $70k

Step #7: Option - run in VR

There are a lot of these options.

Step #8: Haptic feedback suits and gloves

Step #9: Software

Step #9a: Get a Steam account and install Steam app.
PC VR (as opposed to Quest or PlayStation) uses "Steam" software.
Steam is the company and marketplace for PC software.

Step #9b: Install SteamVR
This software gives you the ability to run VR games on the PC.

Varjo's GUI/runtime can run games without it.

But you will want to use this sometimes since there is an ecosystem of apps and devices that work with it.
Examples are:
- full body trackers (for vloggers that dance in VRChat)
- apps that will persist on your wrist to show desktop apps
- apps that show your CPU/GPU stats

There are two "drivers" for VR: SteamVR and OpenXR.
You probably don't need to know that or set any configuration to make it work,
but every once in a while, you might want to set up a config for a particular app.


Step 9c: Install some apps

Best software to get, IMO:
- Half-Life Alyx
  Arguably the only AAA VR game. Great story, graphics, VR-integration

- Microsoft Flight Simulator
  https://store.steampowered.com/app/1250410/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_40th_Anniversary_Edition/
- Population One
  Outstanding competitive team shooter (like fort night and PubG, which I do not like. This is tons of fun)
  https://store.steampowered.com/app/691260/POPULATION_ONE/
- Beat Saber
  https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=beat+saber
