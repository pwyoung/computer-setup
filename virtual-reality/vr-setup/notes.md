Top-end VR setup

The Varjo headsets are the best HMDs (head-mounted displays) in terms of optics, both in terms of pixels-per-degree (PPD) and their use of pancake (non-fresnel) lenses.

They are the only ones that can be used as a substitute for actual flight time in training toward a pilots license.


Recommendation: Varjo Aero
It is the only consumer device they sell.

Other HMDs:

The Varjo XR3 is the best stand-alone/wireless headset, but it costs a lot more, has an annual fee, and is technically only sold to a business.

The Varjo VR3 is the wired version of the XR3. It has two pairs of lenses, for even clearer imaging, but it requires two cables, and is much heavier than the Aero.

Facebook/Meta now has released the Quest Pro.
It is standalone/wireless, with better clarity, but it intentionally allows
light in from the bottom of the lenses. It is not well received by those who have used it. It does support apps that allow rendering to happen on the PC so you can interface with your desktop, or use a PC's GPU to render a VR game and display it on the HMD.

Pimax Crystal and their 8KX are somewhat on par with the Aero, but the company is famous for bad support, inconsistent hardware, and generally catering more to their customers in China. Their 12KX, if it releases next year or so, could be amazing. This is potenti

The Valve Index is 2 years old but is still the choice for e-sports VR competitive players due to the FOV and high frame rate (120 Hz). The down side for this is the resolution and screen-door-effect (SDE) meaning you can see a grid of lines between the pixels if you focus hard enough.

Step #1: Varjo Aero HMD

https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/virtual-reality/products/varjo-aero-headset/352189.html?condition=New&sku=20001267.html

Notes/Background:
- The Aero HMD does not include the base-stations or controllers.
- The Aero uses the "Steam tracking system", which was created for the HTC Vive
and is used by the Valve Index (and some other VR HMDs and tracking devices)
- The HTC Vive "wand" controllers are not good.
- The HTC Vive Steam Tracking system was v1. The Index has V2 which extends the range and angles that the trackers work at. Get v2 if possible, but v1 works.
- The Index Knuckle controllers are the gold standard for VR controllers.

Step #2: Steam Base Stations and (Index Knuckle) controllers.
You should get two base stations and the Index Knuckle controllers.
You can get them separately, or get the full (999) Index kit.

Step #3: PC with a sufficient GPU
The Varjo Aero is only vertified with Nvidia GPUs.

I have and recommend the Nvidia and a 3090 (or 4090 which are just out) GPU.
Some apps still work better with Intel than AMD, so I went with Intel CPU.

This is what I got 2 years ago:

But now, the 4090 GPUs are out:
Here is an Intel+NVidia monster,
